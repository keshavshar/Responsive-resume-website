# Responsive-resume-website

 recently created a Parallax Resume Website to showcase my skills, education, projects, experience, certifications, and more â€” all with a clean, interactive, and visually appealing design.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and the parallax scrolling effect, while also pushing me to focus on user experience and responsive design.

ðŸš€ Tech used: HTML, CSS
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: To build an engaging digital resume that stands out and reflects my creativity and technical skills.

Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback and suggestions! ðŸ“Œ
If anyone is interested, feel free to connect â€” Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and new opportunities.
